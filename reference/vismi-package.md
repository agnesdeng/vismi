# vismi: Visual Diagnostics for Multiple Imputation

A comprehensive suite of static and interactive visual diagnostics for
assessing the quality of multiply-imputed data obtained from packages
such as 'mixgb' and 'mice'. The package supports inspection of
distributional characteristics, diagnostics based on masking observed
values and comparing them with re-imputed values, and convergence
diagnostics.
