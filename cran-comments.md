## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have fixed all reported issues the reviewer mentioned:

- Added `\value` to .Rd files that were missing the return field
- Added a smaller dataset so that examples can be run less than < 5s and removed `dontrun` from examples
- Users can set `verbose = FALSE` (default) to supress all messages
