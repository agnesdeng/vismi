Description: A comprehensive suite of static and interactive visual diagnostics for assessing the quality of multiply-imputed data obtained from packages such as 'mixgb' and 'mice'. The package supports inspection of distributional characteristics, diagnostics based on masking observed values and comparing them with re-imputed values, and convergence diagnostics.
